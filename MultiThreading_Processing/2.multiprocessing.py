# Multiprocessing is a Python module that allows you to run multiple processes in parallel, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space. This is useful for CPU-bound tasks that need to utilize multiple CPU cores, such as data processing, computations, or simulations.

# Use multiprocessing when:
# - Your program is CPU-bound (heavy computations).
# - You want to bypass Pythonâ€™s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).
# - You need true parallelism (not just concurrency).

# For I/O-bound tasks (like network or file operations), threading or async may be more efficient.
