# Covariance and Correlation

Covariance and correlation are two statistical measures that describe the relationship between two variables. Both are used to understand how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable.

## Covariance

Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables change together. It indicates the direction of the linear relationship between the variables. A positive covariance means that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase as well. Conversely, a negative covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease.

### Example

Quantify the relationship between two sets of data:
X = {2,4,6,8}
Y = {3,5,7,9}
