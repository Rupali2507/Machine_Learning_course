# All important formulas and concepts

## Population

It is denoted by  N  and represents the entire group that we want to draw conclusions about.

Population mean, mu = Sum of all the elements / no of elements


Variance , sigma^2 = (xi-mean)^2/N

Standard Deviation = Square_root of variance

Standard deviation tells us how far a data point is away from the mean.


## Sample

It is denoted by n 

sample mean  x =sum(elements)/n

s^2 = (xi-x)^2/(n-1)

Standard deviation = sqrt(Sample variance)
