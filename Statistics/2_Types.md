class Statistics
{180cm,175cm,160cm,170cm,180cm,190cm,175cm,165cm,180cm,170cm}

Descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the heights of the students in college A, such as calculating the mean height, median height, and standard deviation of the heights.

Inferential statistics can be used to make predictions about the heights of students in other colleges based on the sample data from college A, such as estimating the average height of students in a different college or testing whether the average height of students in college A is significantly different from that of another college.
