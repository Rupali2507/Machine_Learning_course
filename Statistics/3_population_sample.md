### Population

Population refers to the entire group of individuals or items that we are interested in studying. It is the complete set of observations or data points that we want to draw conclusions about. For example, if we are studying the average height of all adults in a country, the population would be all adults in that country.
Notation:

- Population is often denoted by the symbol \( N \).

### Sample

A sample is a subset of the population that is selected for analysis. It is used to make inferences about the population without having to study every individual or item in the population. The sample should be representative of the population to ensure that the conclusions drawn from it are valid.
Notation:

- Sample is often denoted by the symbol \( n \).

```
Example: Collect  weights of all the students in a class.
Population: All students in the class.
Sample: A randomly selected group of 30 students from the class.

```
