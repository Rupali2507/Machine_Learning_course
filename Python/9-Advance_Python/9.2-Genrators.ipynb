    "# Generators in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are a special class of functions that simplify the task of writing iterators. They allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator, meaning it can be used in a for loop and can generate values on the fly without storing them all in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the `yield` statement to produce a series of values.\n",
    "- Maintain their state between executions.\n",
    "- More memory-efficient for large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are useful for processing large datasets, pipelines, or streams of data where you don't want to load everything into memory at once."
